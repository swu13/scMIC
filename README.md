# scMIC

## Introduction

We we propose an optimal transport-based framework, `scMIC`, to identify metastasis-initiating cells (MICs) from primary tumor cells.

1. `Processing.R`£º Some utilies for preprocessing of single-cell data

2. `scMIC.py`: input tumor cells of paired primary and metastasis cancer samples to identify MICs in primary tumor.

3. `GeneProgram.py`: Determine MIC-related latent based on single-cell data and MIC labels.

4. `scMIC_unpaired.py`: Identificaiton of MICs in query primary tumor cells based on reference primary tumor cells with reference MIC labels. 

5. `Figure2`: Codes for the data downloading, rocessing and analysis for the Figure2 of the manuscript.

6. `Figure3`: Codes for the data downloading, rocessing and analysis for the Figure3 of the manuscript.

7. `Figure4`: Codes for the data downloading, rocessing and analysis for the Figure4 of the manuscript.

8. `Figure5`: Codes for the data downloading, rocessing and analysis for the Figure5 of the manuscript.

9. `Figure6`: Codes for the data downloading, rocessing and analysis for the Figure6 of the manuscript.

10. `Discussion`: Codes for the data downloading, rocessing and analysis for the Discussion of the manuscript.
